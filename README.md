# Liberate your data: From RDBMS to Search, GraphQL & Mobile ... in minutes!

Reduce the time it takes to modernize your applications by freeing the data trapped in your relational database and migrating to the next-gen fully transactional DB of MongoDB Atlas. Powering it with advanced lucene-based search, enable API consumption via fully-managed GraphQL, and expose to mobile and edge consumers via the Realm mobile DB and SDKâ€™s.

## Prerequisites
* Docker Desktop 4+


## Steps
### Clone & Change Directory
1. ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/mongodb-developer/liberate-data.git && cd liberate-data
   ```

### PostgreSQL
1. Build the image 
   2. ```shell
       docker build -t liberate-data-postgres .
      ```
2. Run the container
   3. ```shell
         docker run -d --name my-postgres -p "5432:5432" -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=password --rm liberate-data-postgres
      ```
3. Exec into the container
   4. ```shell
       docker exec -it my-postgres psql -U postgres
      ```
4. Verify that the following tables with all data were correctly initialized during container startup by running this script:

```postgresql
WITH tbl AS
  (SELECT table_schema,
          TABLE_NAME
   FROM information_schema.tables
   WHERE TABLE_NAME not like 'pg_%'
     AND table_schema in ('northwind'))
SELECT table_schema,
       TABLE_NAME,
       (xpath('/row/c/text()', query_to_xml(format('select count(*) as c from %I.%I', table_schema, TABLE_NAME), FALSE, TRUE, '')))[1]::text::int AS rows_n
FROM tbl
ORDER BY rows_n DESC;
```

output...

```shell

------------------------------------------------
 table_schema |       table_name       | rows_n 
--------------+------------------------+--------
 northwind    | order_details          |   2155
 northwind    | orders                 |    830
 northwind    | customers              |     91
 northwind    | products               |     77
 northwind    | territories            |     53
 northwind    | us_states              |     51
 northwind    | employee_territories   |     49
 northwind    | suppliers              |     29
 northwind    | employees              |      9
 northwind    | categories             |      8
 northwind    | shippers               |      6
 northwind    | region                 |      4
 northwind    | customer_customer_demo |      0
 northwind    | customer_demographics  |      0

```
5. Exit postgres container
   6. ```shell
       \q
      ```

#### MongoDB Atlas
2. [Sign up for Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas/signup) and create an Atlas Project named `Liberate Data` with an Atlas cluster named `production`.
3. Create a user named `demo` with `readWriteAnyDatabase` permissions.
4. Add `0.0.0.0` to your Atlas IP Access List. NOTE: This is not recommneded for production or professional work environments.
#### MongoDB Relational Migrator
5. Install [MongoDB Relational Migrator](https://www.mongodb.com/products/relational-migrator).
6. Import the project [liberate-data.relmig](./relational-migrator/liberate-data.relmig).
7. Inspect the Relational and MDB diagrams. Notice how the `Orders` collection uses the [Subset](https://www.mongodb.com/blog/post/building-with-patterns-the-subset-pattern) schema design pattern to store most frequently accessed data together.
8. The destination Orders collection should look like this:
![Orders collection mapping](./img/orders_mappings.jpg)
9. Perform the data migration by entering your Postgres and Atlas credentials.
   10. Postgres Credentials: Username = `postgres` / Password = `password`
10. When done, navigate to Atlas and ensure all collections were migrated. Inspect the `orders` collection. A subset of the data from orderDetails, product, customer & employee should be nested.
#### MongoDB Atlas Search
11. Create a default search index with dynamic mappings on the `orders` and `categories` collections. See [search-indexes.json](./atlas/search-indexes.json) for their definition.
#### MongoDB Atlas App Services
12. Import the Atlas Application [production-app](./app-services/) into the Atlas project.
13. <b>Linked Data Sources</b>: Inspect that the `production` cluster is linked as the data source.
14. <b>Rules</b>: The `orders` collection should have the `readAndWriteAll` role. All other collections should have the `readAll` role. 
15. <b>Schema</b>: Ensure the schema for all collections is defined. The schema for the `orders` collection should define required fields as below in addition to their bson types:
```
{
  "title": "order",
  "required": [
    "_id",
    "customerId",
    "employeeId",
    "freight",
    "orderDate",
    "shipAddress",
    "shipCity",
    "shipCountry",
    "shipName",
    "shipPostalCode",
    "shipRegion",
    "shipVia",
    "shippedDate"
  ],
  ...
}
```
16. <b>Authentication</b>: Two authentication providers should be enabled: `email/password` and `API Keys`. An API key named `demo` should be (re)created by you.
17. <b>Device Sync</b>: Flexible device sync should be enabled, set to the linked atlas cluster and the northwind database.
18. <b>GraphQL</b>: All entity types should be defined along with a custom resolver named `searchOrders`, which itself is linked to an Atlas Function named `funcSearchOrders`.

#### Postman
19. Install [Postman](https://www.postman.com/downloads/) and import the [liberate-data - GraphQL](./postman/liberate-data%20-%20GraphQL.postman_collection.json) postman collection.
20. In the collection variables, enter the `api_key` and `atlas_app_id` values. Obtain the GraphQL API endpoint from the GraphQL section in Atlas App Services and set in the `graphql_api` variable.
![Postman variable](./img/postman-variables.jpg)
21. Execute the 1st POST operation `Auth: Get Bearer & Access Token` to authenticate and obtain tokens.
22. Execute all other operations in any order. Feel free to change query values.
23. The `Search: Orders by search string` operation uses a custom resolver which in turn executes an Atlas Search pipeline. This pipeline is implemented in the `funcSearchOrders` function and performs a fuzzy text search on the `orders` collection, plus a union (`$unionWith`) and join (`$lookup`) to the `categories` collection, thus performing a text search on orders and categories.

#### Swift mobile app with Realm SDK
24. Install XCode with the [Swift](https://developer.apple.com/swift/) SDK, and open the swift app under the [app-swift](./app-swift/) folder. 
25. Open the Realm object and replace the `appId` and  `appUrl`. Compile and run.
![Swift Realm config](./img/swift-app-config.jpg)
26. In the mobile app, register with a new user via an email and password. 
27. Browse orders. For the purpose of this demo, all users have access to all orders.

#### Atlas Device Sync
28. Modify an order using the mobile app.
20. Open the same Order document in Atlas or Compass and notice the changes. Now modify the same order and the changes will be reflected on the mobile app. Atlas Device Sync works.
30. Finally, run the `Mutation: Change a Sales Order` GraphQL operation in postman. Change the Order ID and any fields in the order body. The changes should reflect in the mobile app.
